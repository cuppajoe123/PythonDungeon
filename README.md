# YAPTA

Yet Another Python Text Adventure

YAPTA is an easy-to-use template for creating your very own Python text adventure. The base game mechanics are already implemented so the developer can focus on creating assets for their adventure. Each game mechanic was built with extensibility in mind so that developers can spend their time working on game assets. Only a fundamental knowledge of Python is needed to use this project, although adding your own features may prove more difficult. Documentation is provided for each game mechanic.
